          <h1>
            Here is the list of activities you can perform while on your desert
            safari with us:
          </h1>
          <h2>Dune Bashing</h2>
          <p>
            Dune bashing in Dubai desert safari is driving a sports vehicle
            (Usually SUV) at fast and slow speeds over sand dunes to boost the
            thrill and due to adrenaline rush. It feels exciting as send keeps
            shifting under the tires of your vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            To drive an SUV on this bumping and thrilling ride requires a
            special skill that is not hard to learn for those who already know
            about driving a car. Dune bashing usually lasts for around 45
            minutes to 1 hour.
          </p>
          <h2>Sandboarding</h2>
          <p>
            One of the common desert safari activities sandboarding is similar
            to snowboarding and comes under the board sports. The Arabian desert
            has no lack of soft shifting sand that allows you to ride down the
            dune with the help of a sandboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a good surfer or snowboarder, sandboarding is easy to
            perform. Meanwhile, there are no fast and hard rules; you can slide
            on a sitting, lying, or back position to relish the moment.
          </p>
          <h2>Camel Ride</h2>
          <p>
            Came on a desert safari and not enjoy a camel ride?..that’s not
            possible at all!! Camel ride is the most traditional way of
            exploring the desert of Dubai. There’s a reason why ancient people
            would use a camel ride to travel around the desert.
          </p>
          <p>
            On camel or horse ride, your evening safari hits more with desert
            sunset behind the dune and orange sky. Also, following Animal
            welfare guidelines during your camel riding is necessary.
          </p>
          <h2>Buffet Dinner</h2>
          <p>

            biryani, chickpeas, lamb kebab, grilled chicken, and many more other
            food items both for vegan and non-vegan visitors. The most famous
            buffet dinner includes BBQ dinner and Shisha (Arabian-style tobacco
            in hubbly bubbly).
          </p>
          <h2>ATV Quad Bike Ride</h2>
          <p>

            called an ATV bike. You can ride an ATV bike on many different
            terrains like snow, mountain, and sand.
          </p>
          <p>
            On desert safari tour, ATV quad bike ride is performed on silky
            sliding sand over low and high sand dunes. ATV bike has low air
            pressure in its tires for complete traction and grip.
          </p>
          <h2>Belly Dance</h2>
          <p>
            Belly dance is one of the oldest expressive dance performances of
            Arabs. After your evening safari tour, when you get back to your
            desert camp, you can watch a live belly dance performance while
            enjoying the buffet.
          </p>
          <h2>Fire Show</h2>
          <p>
            On your desert safari trip, you get a chance to watch goosebumps
            giving fire acts. The highly trained fire eaters, fire walkabouts,
            fire dancers, and fire characters surprise you with their fine art
            and actions.
          </p>

            desert safari Dubai. It is usually performed by a man who
            continuously on Sufi music, making the performance one of the
