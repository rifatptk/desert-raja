            The most thrilling feature of our overnight desert safari is the
            dune bash activity carried out in a 4×4 dune bash or dune buggy,
            over the red dunes of the endless desert for 45 minutes straight!
            Yes! 45 minutes of absolute fun and adventure in the Dubai desert.
          </p>
          <p>
            All overnight desert stay packages of our overnight desert safari
            tour include other complementary activities such as the popular
            camel ride, sandboarding tasks, as well as a wider and insightful
            view of the Dubai desert as a whole.
          </p>

          <h2>ATV Quad Bike Ride:</h2>
          <p>
            You can self-ride a Quad Bike 200-350 cc, recruit and perform a
            circuit race with your buddies in the evening safari. Quad bikes in
            our package are the most exemplar way of saying that we are here to

            A pre-included offer in all the overnight desert safari packages,
            160 sandboarding is an alternative to snowboarding and snow, in
            general. What happens here is that you are needed to balance the
            board over dunes instead of skis, and hence the name sandboarding.
          </p>

          <h2>Camel Ride:</h2>
          <p>
            If you go to Dubai on an overnight safari and do not enroll in the

            famous cultural activities of the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Camel ride is also a great way to keep the kids engaged, trekking
            into the desert on a humped camel. The camels we extend for trekking
            are well trained and very friendly.
          </p>
          <h2>Dinner & Breakfast:</h2>

            dinner after the sun sets and you are chilling out in your private

            recipes reflecting the Indo-Pak food culture such as Falafel,
            Hummus, etc. A scrumptious breakfast after a good-night sleep in the
            open desert in Abu Dhabi is one of the best morning desert
            experiences offered by our overnight desert stay safari. Start your
            day with a complimentary scrumptious breakfast of eggs, slices, jam,
            tea or coffee, and juices while watching the stunning desert
