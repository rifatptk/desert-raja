          </h2>
          <p>
            Catering to your wildest thrill-seeking desires, dune bashing is a
            wonderful experience that is loaded with moments that make you
            scream in excitement and hold on tight. You will witness the hidden
            gems of Dubai as you tour the early morning desert in a 4×4 vehicle
            that takes you up and down the tall sand dunes. Well, no time to
            relax though. The journey has just begun.
          </p>
          <h2>Sand boarding</h2>
          <p>
            Your adventures just began with the dune bashing. You will hop on to
            your sand board and surf down the beautiful desert with the
            beautiful red dunes standing proud around you. With a short camel
            ride, we guarantee this is among the most fun you will have during
            your trip of Dubai city, United Arab Emirates. This desert safari
            just got so much better!
          </p>
          <h2>Camel Ride</h2>
          <p>
            All of our guests unanimously agree that the camel ride is one of
            their favorite parts of the tour. The safari is incomplete if you
            don’t take the time to explore the dunes and beauty of the desert
            atop a camel. This is an adventure unlike any other and the camel is
            such a lovely and friendly animal as you will see. You will be going
            home with a very different perspective about these wonderful animals
            after your visit.
          </p>
          <h2>Capturing Memories</h2>
          <p>

            we will make sure to capture your reaction video during the safari

          <p>
            There are plenty of fun spots during the tour where you can click
            photos. Pose on the dunes or wave from the camel or . Make sure you
            take many photos and make this journey as memorable as you can. You
            can also pose with the desert falcon for a frame worthy shot.
          </p>
          <h2>Quad Biking (Optional)</h2>
          <p>
            For those who want a bit more adventure, we recommend touring the
            desert on a quad bike. It is safe and lets you add excitement to
            your trip. Even more so than sandboarding. The morning desert safari
            package offered by us does not include quad biking. But by paying
            extra for the quad biking experience, you would have taken the
            desert safari to a whole other level with the quad bike, of course.
            The morning desert is optimal for those who love to ride.
